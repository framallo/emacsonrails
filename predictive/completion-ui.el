;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package provides a user-interface for in-buffer text
;; completion. It doesn't find completions itself. Instead, a completion
;; package can simply set the `completion-function' variable to a
;; function that takes two arguments, a string PREFIX and an integer
;; MAXNUM, and returns a list of at most MAXNUM completion candidates
;; for PREFIX. Completion-UI does the rest.
;;
;; That's it! Completion-UI, the auto-completion minor mode, and user
;; customizations take care of the rest. (Avoid the temptation to set
;; completion-UI customization variables from Elisp code to alter its
;; behaviour. The user knows what they want better than you do!)
;;
;; Examples are available on the Emacs wiki, at:
;; www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/CompletionUI
;;
;; Why use completion-UI? Typically, a lot of code in packages providing
;; some kind of text completion deals with the user interface. The
;; ultimate goal is that all packages providing in-buffer (and possibly
;; one day also mini-buffer) completion should use this package to
;; provide a common user interface, freeing them to concentrate on
;; finding the completion candidates in the first place. The Elisp
;; programmer benfits by not having to reinvent the wheel, and the Emacs
;; user benefits by having a standard yet highly customizable
;; user-interface that they can customize once and for all to to suit
;; their preferences, for all completion mechanisms they use.
;;
;; Various completion user-interfaces are provided, all of which can be
;; individually enabled, disabled and extensively tweaked via
;; customization variables:
;;
;; * Dynamic completion: provisionally insert the first available
;;   completion candidate into the buffer.
;;
;; * Completion hotkeys: single-key selection of a completion
;;   candidate.
;;
;; * Cycling: cycle through completion candidates.
;;
;; * Tab-completion: "traditional" expansion to longest common
;;   substring.
;;
;; * Help-echo: display a list of completion candidates in the
;;   echo-area.
;;
;; * Tooltip: display a list of completion candidates in a tool-tip
;;   located below the point, from which completions can be selected.
;;
;; * Pop-up frame: display a list of completion candidates in a pop-up
;;   frame located below the point, which can be toggled between display
;;   some or all completions, and from which completions can be
;;   selected.
;;
;; * Completion menu: allow completion candidates to be selected from
;;   a drop-down menu located below the point.
;;
;; * Completion browser: browse through all possible completion
;;   candidates in a hierarchical deck-of-cards menu located below the
;;   point.
;;
;; Completion-UI also provides a new minor mode, called
;; auto-completion-mode. When enabled, Emacs will automatically complete
;; words as they are typed, using the `completion-function' to find
;; completion candidates. The same customization variables determine how
;; those candidates are displayed and can be selected. This works
;; particularly well with dynamic completion (see above).
;;
;; This package will work alongside the auto-overlays package if it's
;; available, but does not require it.



;;; Change Log:
;;
;; Version 0.9
;; * added `completion-includes-prefix' variable to indicate that completions
;;   returned by `completion-function' include the prefix
;; * added `completion-replaces-prefix' variable to indicate that completions
;;   should replace the prefix when they're accepted, and made changes to
;;   almost all of the user-interface functions to cope with this non-prefix
;;   completion (thanks to Henry Weller for helpful discussions about this)
;; * move point to appropriate position in parent frame when cycling through
;;   completions in pop-up frame
;; * added `completion-show-browser-menu' command
;;
;; Version 0.8.2
;; * prevented `completion-show-tooltip' from moving mouse unless absolutely
;;   necessary (thanks to Martin Pohlack for reporting this)
;; * modified `completion-show-tooltip' to ensure tooltip is cancelled before
;;   (re)displaying it, otherwise `x-show-tip' "magically" moves it to the top
;;   of the frame! (thanks to Martin Pohlack for reporting this)
;; * added option to highlight longest common prefix in a dynamic completion
;;   (thanks to Vagn Johansen for the suggestion)
;; * actually make use of `completion-popup-frame-function' variable!
;; * fixed bug in some calls to `completion-reject-functions' that only passed
;;   two arguments instead of three (thanks to Vagn Johansen for reporting
;;   this)
;;
;; Version 0.8,1
;; * fix `completion-define-word-syntax-binding' so it creates key binding in
;;   `auto-completion-dynamic-map' as it should
;; * fix `completion-setup-overlay' to assign correct keymap to 'keymap
;;   property, depending on whether `auto-completion-mode' is enabled or not
;;
;; Version 0.8
;; * give completion overlay a non-nil end-advance property, because...
;; * ...keymap property works for zero-length overlays with non-nil
;;   end-advance since Emacs 22! So disable work-around from that versions on.
;;
;; Version 0.7.5
;; * added `completion-simulate-overlay-bindings' function that can
;;   automatically create key bindings to simulate overlay keymap bindings
;;   using the `completion-run-if-within-overlay' hack
;;
;; Version 0.7.4
;; * split `completion-self-insert' into two: one function, the new
;;   `completion-self-insert', deals with completion-related stuff if
;;   auto-completion-mode is disabled, the other,
;;   `auto-completion-self-insert', does auto-completion as
;;   before. This allows individual printable characters to invoke
;;   auto-completion without auto-completion-mode being enabled.
;; * `auto-completion-self-insert' is now only directly bound to
;;   printable characters in auto-completion-map
;; * overlay keymap now binds printable characters to the new
;;   `completion-self-insert' (which hands off to
;;   `auto-completion-self-insert' if auto-completion is enabled)
;;
;; Version 0.7.3
;; * fixed bug in `completion-popup-frame-toggle-show-all'
;; * fixed bug in definition of `completion-tooltip-face'
;;
;; Version 0.7.2
;; * prevent `complete-in-buffer' from auto-displaying the tooltip/menu/pop-up
;;   frame if there are no completions (otherwise Emacs CVS seems to crash!)
;; * bug fixes to key bindings and `completion-tab-complete'
;; * bug fixes to pop-up frames
;;
;; Version 0.7.1
;; * minor key binding fixes
;; * `complete-in-buffer' can now take an optional prefix argument to override
;;   automatically determined prefix
;; * `completion-self-insert' can now take an optional argument that causes
;;   `auto-completion-syntax-override-alist' to be ignored, as can
;;   `completion-define-word-constituent-binding'
;; * bug fixes to `completion-self-insert'
;; * switched ordering of `auto-completion[-override]-syntax-alist' entries
;;   back to something closer to old ordering
;;
;; Version 0.7
;; * modified core `complete-in-buffer', `complete-word-at-point',
;;   `completion-self-insert' and `completion-backward-delete' functions
;;   to allow `completion-prefix-function' to properly take over prefix
;;   finding
;; * created default `completion-prefix' function
;; * modified same core functions so that completion behaviour is more
;;   intelligent, especially when a character is inserted within a
;;   completion overlay
;; * `completion-overwrite' option now controls whether completions
;;   over-write the remainder of the word at the point or not
;; * renamed `completion-dynamic-*syntax-alist' to
;;   `auto-completion-*syntax-alist' and modified their format somewhat;
;;   behaviour now accessed through interface macros
;; * added new pop-up frame completion method (thanks to anon. on the
;;   Emacs wiki for the suggestion)
;; * auto-show can now display one out of the tooltip, completion menu,
;;   or pop-up frame
;; * `completion-tooltip-delay' and `completion-auto-show-menu' options
;;   subsumed into `completion-auto-show' and
;;   `completion-auto-show-delay'
;; * RET binding now respects customization options
;;
;; Version 0.6.5
;; * bug-fixes to interactive definitions
;; * moved modification hook setting to end of file
;;
;; Version 0.6.4
;; * defined properties to make delete-selection-mode work correctly
;;   (thanks to Sivaram for drawing my attention to this)
;; * minor improvement to text displayed in completion browser bucket
;;   menu entries
;;
;; Version 0.6.3
;; * fixed M-<space> bindings so that prefix argument is passed to
;;   `completion-reject', and fixed C-<space> bindings
;;
;; Version 0.6.2
;; * modified the default `completion-dynamic-syntax-alist' to make
;;   parentheses behave like punctuation
;; * minor bug-fix to `completion-show-menu-if-within-overlay'
;; * fixed `completion-self-insert' again so that it works if called with
;;   an explicit char (auto-fill will not work in that case)
;; * fixed `complete-dynamic' so that the completion overlay ends up in
;;   the right place even when modification hooks cause text to be
;;   inserted in the buffer during its execution
;;
;; Version 0.6.1
;; * modified define-minor-mode usage for auto-completion-mode to work in
;;   older Emacs versions
;; * fixed `completion-self-insert' so that auto-fill works again
;; * if command remapping isn't supported, attempt to simulate it more
;;   effectively for deletion commands
;;
;; Version 0.6
;; * added `completion-prefix' and `completion-tooltip' variables to
;;   allow overriding of default methods for determining prefix at point
;;   and constructing tooltip text
;; * fixed bugs related to backwards-deletion (thanks to Maciej
;;   Katafiasz for pointing some of these out)
;; * added optional arguements to `completion-self-insert' to allow
;;   automatically determined character and syntax to be overridden, and
;;   created key bindings to insert characters as word constituents
;; * modified `completion-backward-delete', created corresponding
;;   `completion-delete' function, and defined a whole host of deletion
;;   and kill commands that are substituted for the standard ones
;; * added convenience function
;;   `completion-define-word-constituent-binding' for defining bindings
;;   to insert characters as word-constituents
;;
;;
;; Version 0.5.2
;; * fixed tooltip face issues, which included defining a new
;;   `completion-tooltip-face'
;; * implemented better method of positioning tooltip, avoiding moving
;;   the mouse (thanks to Nikolaj Schumacher for this!)
;;
;; Version 0.5.1
;; * fixed small bug in `completion-self-insert' (thanks to Nikolaj
;;   Schumacher for pointing it out)
;;
;; Version 0.5
;; Modifications arising from discussions with rms:
;; * removed `completion-define-minor-mode' macro; to use completion-UI,
;;   `completion-function' should just be set appropriately
;; * auto-completion is now a separate minor mode
;; * renamed various variables and functions
;;
;; Version 0.4.1
;; * small but important bug-fix to `completion-accept'
;;
;; Version 0.4
;; * accept and reject hooks now called with two or three arguments
;;   instead of one: the prefix, the full word (this is what was passed
;;   previously) and possibly the interactive prefix argument.

;;   variable, instead of testing if 'trap-recursion is bound
;;
;; Version 0.3.8
;; * fixed `completion-run-if-within-overlay' so it doesn't error if
;;   there's no "normal" binding for the key sequence used to invoke it
;; * defined a new `completion-trap-recursion' variable in case the
;;   symbol trap-recursion is bound outside
;;   `completion-run-if-within-overlay'
;;
;; Version 0.3.7
;; * fixed M-<space> binding so it's only active within an overlay
;;
;; Version 0.3.6
;; * fixed bug in `completion-define-minor-mode'
;;
;; Version 0.3.5
;; * added eval-when-compile to prevent bogus compilation errors
;;
;; Version 0.3.4
;; * added function to `after-change-functions' to hide tooltip
;; * made self-insert behaviour alists more flexible
;; * minor fix to `completion-cycle' to leave point at end of word if

(defcustom auto-completion-syntax-alist '(reject . word)
  "*Associates character syntax with completion behaviour.
Used by the `auto-completion-self-insert' function to decide what
to do based on a typed character's syntax.

The predefined choices can be used to set two syntax-dependent
completion behaviours: how the prefix is chosen when characters
are typed, and how provisional completions are accepted. These
are specified by a cons cell, whose cdr is either \"type
normally\" or \"punctuation accepts\", and controls how
completions are accepted, and whose car is either \"word\" or
\"string\", and controls how the prefix is chosen.

If the car is set to \"type normally\", the provisional
completions that appear as you type are only accepted if you call
`completion-accept' manually. You are free to ignore them
entirely and type normally. If the car is instead set to
\"punctuation accepts\", the provisional completions are
automatically accepted whenever you type any punctuation or
whitespace character (as defined by the buffers' syntax
table). For example, hitting SPC will usually accept the current
provisional completion and insert a space after it. Once your
fingers get used to it, this can allow you to type faster as you
can quickly accept a completion and move onto the next
word. However, you can no longer entirely ignore the completions
and type normally, since you may accidentally accept a completion
you didn't want.

If the cdr is set to \"word\", typing a word-constituent
character (as defined by the buffers' syntax table) will cause
the part of the word before point to be completed. That is, the
completion prefix will be all those characters in the word at
point that come before the point (`completion-word-thing'
determines which characters form the word). If the cdr is instead
set to \"string\", typing a word-constituent character will
complete the current string that has been built up by typing
characters. That is, the prefix will consist of the characters
you've typed sequentially in the buffer. The two behaviours
usually only differ if you insert characters in the middle or at
the end of an existing word.


Customizing the behaviour for each syntax individually gives more
fine-grained control over the syntax-dependent completion
behaviour. In this case, the value of
`auto-completion-syntax-alist' must be an alist associating
syntax descriptors (characters) with behaviours (two-element
lists).

The first element of the list must be one of symbols 'accept,
'reject or 'add. The first two again have the same meaning as in
the predefined behaviours, whereas 'add causes characters with
that syntax to be added to the current completion prefix.

The second element of the list must be one of the symbols 'word,
'string or 'none. 'word and 'string have the same meaning as in
the predefined behaviours, though they now apply only to one
syntax class, whereas 'none prevents characters with that syntax
from invoking auto-completion.


When `auto-completion-syntax-alist' is set from Lisp code, in
addition to the symbol values described above the list entries
can also be functions which return one of those symbols. The list
can also have an additional third entry, which determines whether
the typed character is inserted or not: the character is inserted
if it is non-nil, not if it is nil. Again if the third entry is a
function, its return value determines the insertion behaviour."
