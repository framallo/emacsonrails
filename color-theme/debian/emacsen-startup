;; The color-theme-el package follows the Debian/GNU Linux
;; 'emacsen' policy and byte-compiles its elisp files for each 'emacs
;; flavor' (emacs19, xemacs19, emacs20, xemacs20...).  The compiled
;; code is then installed in a subdirectory of the respective
;; site-lisp directory.  We have to add this to the load-path:
(cond
 ((not (file-exists-p "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/color-theme-el"))
  (message "Package color-theme-el removed but not purged.  Skipping setup."))
 ((not (file-exists-p (concat "/usr/share/"
                              (symbol-name debian-emacs-flavor)
                              "/site-lisp/color-theme-el/color-theme-autoloads.el")))
  (message "Package color-theme-el not fully installed.  Skipping setup."))
 (t
  (when (fboundp 'debian-pkg-add-load-path-item)
    (debian-pkg-add-load-path-item (concat "/usr/share/"
                                           (symbol-name flavor)
                                           "/site-lisp/color-theme-el")))

  (load "color-theme-autoloads.el")))
